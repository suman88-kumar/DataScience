# Since all the combination of tests return a p-value of 0 and the confidence intervals donot contain 0, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that Tooth-length is directly co-related to dose.
# Summary
# We can conclude that supplement type may not have any effect on tooth growth, but increasing the dose level leads to increased tooth growth.
